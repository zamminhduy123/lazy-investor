Goal: Create the frontend for a "Lazy Investor" Dashboard for the Vietnamese Stock Market. The goal is to minimize reading time and maximize insight.
Tech Stack: React, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (icons), Recharts (optional, for simple sparklines).
The Layout Strategy (The "Executive Brief"):
Please build a single-page dashboard with the following three distinct sections, arranged vertically:
Top Section: The Watchlist Ribbon (Market Pulse)
A horizontal row of cards for the user's tracked stocks (e.g., HPG, FPT, MWG).
Each card should display: Ticker Symbol, Current Price, and % Change (Green for positive, Red for negative).
Interaction: Clicking a card filters the News and AI Summary sections below for that specific stock. Default view is "All Watchlist".
Middle Section: The AI Intelligence Center (The "Lazy" Feature)
This is the most important section. It should look like a premium "Briefing" card.
State A (Loading/Idle): A clean, prominent button that says "✨ Generate Daily Market Briefing".
State B (Analyzed): A structured text area showing the "Consolidated AI Summary". It should have:
Headline: The most critical market narrative.
Sentiment Meter: A visual bar or badge (Bullish/Bearish/Neutral).
Key Takeaways: Bullet points summarizing the collective news.
UX Note: This replaces the need to summarize individual articles one by one.
Bottom Section: The Evidence Feed (Raw News)
A list of the latest news headlines related to the selected stocks.
Design: Clean, dense rows (Title, Source, Time ago).
Action: Each row has a small "Expand" or "Analyze" icon if the user wants to drill down into that specific article.
Visual Style & Theme:
Palette: "Institutional Clean". Use Slate-500/900 for text, clean white backgrounds, and subtle borders.
Colors: Use distinct, standard financial colors for data (Emerald Green for up, Rose Red for down).
Vibe: Minimalist, data-heavy but not cluttered. Think "Linear" or "Robinhood Web".
Data Mocking:
Since the backend isn't fully connected, please mock the data with realistic Vietnamese stock examples (e.g., HPG at 28,000 VND, FPT at 96,000 VND).
Mock the AI response to show how the markdown summary would render.
